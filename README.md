# PHP MySQL Help System
### Currently on v3.1.5
A free support system powered by PHP and MySQL. Runs on PHP 8.

Simple! Safe! Free! Secure!

Auto-configuration included!

Please report any issues in the Issues tab!

Upload all files into a `help` or `support` directory.

Unlike ZenDesk, this is free!

Made in California :us:.

A slimmed-down version of another system I made for myself.

DO NOT DELETE THE `article` FOLDER!!!

**Note: This software requires some advanced configuration. Please only use this software if you know PHP and MySQL fluently.**
